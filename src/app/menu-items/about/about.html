    <h3>Most Recent Temperatures</h3>
    <p>
      The value of the most recent temperature for a device is the most recent recorded temperature
      that has been recorded in the past 10 minutes. Most recent recorded temperatures that were
      recorded more than 10 minutes in the past are not considered 'most recent temperatures' for
      the purposes of the application as they might not give an accurate description of the
      temperature around the device at the moment (e.g. a most recent temperature reading from a day
      ago might not reflect the temperature conditions around the device at the moment).
    </p>

    <h3>Average Temperatures</h3>
    <p>
      The values displayed for average temperatures for location cards on the 'View Home' screen are
      calculated using the most recent temperature (see rule above) for each registered device for
      the location. The most recent temperature (if recorded in the past 10 minutes) for each device
      registered for a location will be used to determine the average temperature for the location.
